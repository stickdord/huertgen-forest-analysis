**AAR 22nd Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division**
**Subject: Operations in the Hürtgen Forest, 16-28 October 1944**

**1. SITUATION:**
The regiment was ordered to advance through the dense, coniferous forest of the Hürtgen, a sector characterized by rugged terrain, few roads, and extensive enemy fortifications. The forest floor was a carpet of pine needles, muffling sound and concealing movement. Enemy forces, primarily from the 275th Infantry Division, were well-entrenched, utilizing concrete bunkers ("dragon's teeth") and pre-sighted artillery on the high ground. The local civilian population had been evacuated, but evidence of their abrupt departure was present in the abandoned villages of Vossenack and Schmidt. The key objective was the town of Schmidt and the vital road network (Kall Trail) leading to it.

**2. MISSION:**
22nd Infantry Regiment, attached to the 5th Armored Division, will attack to seize and secure the town of Schmidt, thereby securing the eastern flank of the VII Corps' advance.

**3. EXECUTION:**
The 2nd Battalion, under LTC Peterson, moved out on 16 Oct, advancing on a narrow front towards the village of Germeter. Progress was slow due to torrential rain turning the few tracks into mud and heavy enemy fire from the fortified ridges. 1st Battalion, LTC Dunning, was held in reserve. On 18 Oct, 2nd Battalion secured Germeter at a high cost in men and materiel.

The main assault on Schmidt began on 26 Oct, with 1st and 2nd Battalions advancing. 3rd Battalion, LTC Foster, remained to secure the line of communication. The attack immediately bogged down in the "Kall Gorge" where engineers were unable to bridge the Kall Creek under intense enemy fire. Armor support from the attached 707th Tank Battalion was neutralized by the muddy terrain and anti-tank obstacles. By 28 Oct, the attack was stalled with the regiment having suffered approximately 30% casualties. The order of battle for the enemy was confirmed to include elements of the 275th and 353rd Infantry Divisions.
